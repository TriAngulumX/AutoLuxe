# AutoLuxe

Created By Johnstri

This is the AutoLuxe website which is a car sales website with the application of the Weighted Product method to determine the car that matches the value that has been inputted by the user on each predetermined criterion.
The criteria that have been determined are:
1. Car Type (Benefit)
2. Car Price (Cost)
3. Year of Production (Benefit)
4. Passenger Capacity (Benefit)
5. Fuel consumption (Benefit)

There is a status on each criterion, namely “Cost” and “Benefit” in decision making. If there is one criterion that uses the Cost status, then the smaller the weight given, the more favorable it will be for the user and this status focuses on reducing expenses. This Cost status is the opposite of Benefit, which if the weight given is greater, it will benefit the user in the decision system and focus on increasing benefits.
